Use `apms help` for information on how to install, update and remove packages!

# Don't have APMS installed yet?

Open a terminal and type `git clone https://github.com/AzineOS/APMS -b dev`
`cd APMS` then `cd apms` (2 SEPERATE COMMANDS, DO THEM BOTH.)
Ensure you have RUST installed on your system.
Type `cargo build` and wait.

Then it's done! That's APMS installed. To use APMS at current you need to use the test server, see below for more information.
